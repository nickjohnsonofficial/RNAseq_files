# RNAseq_files
This repository is just to collect my simple codes for an automated bulk RNAseq analysis and is a Work In Progress

Create a folder labeled 'scripts' in your chosen directory, then copy the following files into the new scripts folder: A_NEW_RNAseq_project.sh, B_RNAseq_analysis_all.sh, C_unzip_seq.sh, D_RNAseq_analysis_1.sh, and E_RNAseq_analysis_2.R

Create a folder labeled 'Genome_Indices' in your chosen directory. Download the appropriate Genome Indices from https://ensembl.org/info/about/species.html to the 'Genome_Indices' folder.

If you want to run this code, first open NEW_RNAseq_project.sh in Notepad and define your base directory! Then run the NEW_RNAseq_project.sh in the command line by typing bash /path/to/scripts/A_NEW_RNAseq_project.sh

The program will direct you to provide information at various points, but will otherwise run itself.
