# RNAseq_files
This repository is just to collect my simple codes for an automated bulk RNAseq analysis and is a Work In Progress

If you want to run this code, copy all the files into one directory start by running running NEW_RNAseq_project.sh in the command line. The program will direct you to provide information at various points, but will otherwise run itself.
